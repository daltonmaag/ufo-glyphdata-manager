# Glyph Data Manager

Store your family-wide glyph data in a central CSV file instead of duplicated in every UFO.

## Todo

- Convert between Glyphs.app GlyphData.xml and CSV
    - Decide on subset of data to convert
- Read (and delete) data from UFOs into CSVs
- Write CSV data into UFOs
- Add arguments on which pieces of data (columns) to write?
